# Go Lang 

### hello world

This is your Go code. In this code, you:

- Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions).
- Import the popular fmt package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.
- Implement a main function to print a message to the console. A main function executes by default when you run code in the file.
