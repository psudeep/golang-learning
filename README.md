### hello world

This is your Go code. In this code, you:

- run the hello.go file `go run hello.go`
- Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions).
- Import the popular fmt package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.
- Implement a main function to print a message to the console. A main function executes by default when you run code in the file.

### importing a package/module

- import "rsc.io/quote" (quote module)
- https://pkg.go.dev/search?q=quote
- `go mod init hello` creates go.mod file with module name hello
- `go run hello.go`  Run your code to see the message generated by the function you're calling
